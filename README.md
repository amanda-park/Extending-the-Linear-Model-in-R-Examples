# Faraway-R-Code-Examples-Regression
These are coding assignments that were given to me in my graduate classes for Regression. Covers Linear Models with R and Extending the Linear Model in R. The interpretation is not necessarily commented in the code as I wrote the analysis in LaTeX for these assignments, but hopefully, this can be a useful resource to someone!
